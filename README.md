# Mock Interview System Using LLM

This project is a mock interview system that leverages a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to conduct interviews based on the user's resume. The system parses the uploaded resume, generates relevant interview questions, evaluates the responses, and provides detailed feedback in a downloadable PDF format.

## Features

- **Resume Parsing**: Upload your resume in PDF or DOCX format.
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: The LLM reads the resume and generates tailored interview questions.
- **Response Evaluation**: The LLM analyzes the interview responses.
- **Feedback Report**: Receive a comprehensive feedback report in PDF format.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive interface to interact with the system.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
- **Groq**: For leveraging the pre-trained LLM.
- **LangChain**: For integrating the LLM functionalities.
- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **PDF and DOCX Parsing Libraries**: To handle resume uploads and parsing.
